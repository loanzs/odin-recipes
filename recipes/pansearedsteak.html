    <h2>Season, sear, and savor the perfect blend of crispy crust and juicy tenderness.</h2>
    <p>Pan-seared steak is a culinary delight, featuring a quality cut like ribeye or New York strip 
        generously seasoned and brought to room temperature. In a hot, oiled pan, the meat sizzles, creating 
        a caramelized crust while maintaining a juicy interior. The searing process, just minutes on each side, 
        captures succulence, delivering a mouthwatering contrast of crispy exterior and tender, preferred center. 
        It's a timeless, delectable experience, each bite releasing a burst of savory goodness.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 boneless ribeye or New York strip steaks (about 1 inch thick)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>Optional: Garlic cloves, fresh herbs (rosemary or thyme)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Steaks</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Take the steaks out of the refrigerator and let them come to room temperature for about 
                    30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Pat the steaks dry with paper towels. Season both sides generously with salt and pepper.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Preheat the Pan</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat a heavy-duty skillet or cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. Add olive oil and allow 
                    it to get hot but not smoking.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Sear the Steaks</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Carefully place the steaks in the hot pan. Cook for 3-4 minutes on one side without moving 
                    them to achieve a nice crust.</li>
                <li>Flip the steaks using tongs and sear the other side for an additional 3-4 minutes. Adjust 
                    the time based on your desired doneness.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Add Flavor (Optional)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In the last minute of cooking, add butter, garlic, and fresh herbs to the pan. Tilt the 
                    pan and spoon the melted butter over the steaks.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Rest and Slice</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Remove the steaks from the pan and let them rest on a cutting board for 5 minutes. This 
                    allows the juices to redistribute.</li>
                <li>Slice the steaks against the grain and serve.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Optional: Pan Sauce</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If desired, use the pan drippings to make a simple pan sauce. Add a splash of broth or wine 
                    to the hot pan, scrape up any browned bits, and let it reduce slightly. Pour the sauce over 
                    the sliced steaks.</li>
            </ul>
    </ol>
