    <h2>An easy, 1-pan, 30-minute meal that is loaded with fresh broccoli, tender nutrition-packed beef, 
        and the best stir fry sauce. </h2>
    <p>Beef and Broccoli is a classic Chinese-American stir-fry featuring tender slices of marinated flank steak, 
        vibrant broccoli florets, and a savory brown sauce. The dish showcases a perfect harmony of textures and 
        flavors, with the beef's umami richness complemented by the crispness of blanched broccoli. Infused with 
        garlic, ginger, and a well-balanced sauce, this quick and flavorful stir-fry is commonly served over 
        steamed white rice, embodying the delicious simplicity of Chinese-American cuisine.</p>

                    marinated beef and stir-fry until it's browned and cooked through. Remove the beef from

                    Cook for about 30 seconds until fragrant. Add the blanched broccoli and stir-fry for a 
                    couple of minutes.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Combine and Sauce</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Return the cooked beef to the wok with the broccoli. Pour the prepared sauce over the beef 
                    and broccoli. Toss everything together until well-coated and heated through.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Serve</li>
